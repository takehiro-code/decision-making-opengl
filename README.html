<p>Introduction to Decision Making in Engineering - 2020 Summer</p>
<b>If you cannot run the program, please follow the development environment setup explained below. As I have already downloaded everything in the external
    resources folder, you can just continue setting the paths in the visual studio properties only.</b>
<h3 id="how-to-run-exe-file-important-">HOW TO RUN .EXE file - IMPORTANT!!</h3>
<p>Since the way I coded of how I read the filepath of .glsl files, the OpenGLVS.exe file cannot run properly from the
    x64/debug folder. You will need to copy this .exe file and place in the project directory of /OpenGLVS folder. I
    will explain in the video of how run executable at HOW_TO_RUN_EXE_FILE.mp4.
</p>

<h3 id="how-to-run-exe-file-important-">File Structure</h3>
<p> Another important video will be file_structure_IMPORTANT.mp4 that explains the structure of my files.</p>
<ul>
    <li>External Resources: 4 libraries included.</li>
    <li>OpenGLVS/data: image and csv file of data are stored here.</li>
    <li>OpenGLVS/DiscussionAndResult: DiscussionAndResult.html discusses the result of each question. There is also a markdown file but this is legacy file.</li>
    <li>OpenGLVS/NarratedVideo: All the videos are stored here.</li>
    <li>OpenGLVS/OpenGLVS: All the codes are included here with a .exe file.</li>
    <li>OpenGLVS/x64: Don't worry about this folder. .exe file in this folder will not work. Copy the .exe and place in the OpenGLVS/OpenGLVS.</li>
    <li>OpenGLVS/OpenGLVS.sln: Visual studio solution file. Open this to run visual studio.</li>
    <li>OpenGLVS/.gitattributes and .gitignore: For my own convenience for git usage.</li>
    <li>OpenGLVS/README.html: This file you are reading.</li>
    <li>OpenGLVS/README_old.md: Legacy file.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>glfw, glew setup:</strong>
    Follow this youtube: <a
        href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gCkcP0GcCe0">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gCkcP0GcCe0</a></p>
<p><strong>glm setup:</strong></p>
<ol>
    <li>Download zip file from <a href="https://github.com/g-truc/glm/tags">https://github.com/g-truc/glm/tags</a></li>
    <li>Extract it to any place as a folder &quot;glm/&quot;.</li>
    <li>In visual studio, right click the project, go to properties, go to C++, and then General. Then, edit the
        Additional Include Directories and add the path to the glm folder &quot;YOUR_SOME_PATH/glm&quot;.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>FreeType setup:</strong></p>
<ol>
    <li>Download .tar.gz file from <a
            href="https://download.savannah.gnu.org/releases/freetype/">https://download.savannah.gnu.org/releases/freetype/</a>
    </li>
    <li>Extract it to any place as a folder &quot;FreeType/&quot;. Name of the folder can be anything.</li>
    <li>Compile the library: Go to freetype directory, open the solution file in builds/windows/vc2010 with Visual
        Studio. Choose Release and x64 (if you are using 64 bit windows) and build it to get *.lib files.</li>
    <li>In visual studio, right click the project, go to properties, go to C++, and then General. Then, edit the
        Additional Include Directories and add the path to the glm folder &quot;YOUR_SOME_PATH/FreeType/include&quot;.
    </li>
    <li>Continuing in Visual Studio, go to Linker, and then General. Then, edit the Additional Library Directories and
        add the path to the FreeType folder &quot;YOUR_SOME_PATH/FreeType/objs/x64/Release&quot;.</li>
    <li>Then go to Linker input, edit the Additional Dependencies, and add &quot;freetype.lib&quot;. Make sure to check
        the library name from the built path &quot;YOUR_SOME_PATH/FreeType/objs/x64/Release&quot; since the library
        could be different for different version.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>stb_image.h:</strong>
    Go to <a
        href="https://github.com/nothings/stb/blob/master/stb_image.h">https://github.com/nothings/stb/blob/master/stb_image.h</a>
    and download the header file and place into your own project directory. No setting of the project needed.
    Alternatively, you can place this outside of project directory and cofigure your project setting by going to project
    setting in VS, go to C++, General, Include Additional Library
    and add the path to this header file, which is the same procedure as glm setup.</p>
